# Coupled-FHN

 Introduction to Research II project at Universidad de Chile, under the guidance of Prof. Ignacio Bordeu and MSc. Javier Cubillos.

### Abstract:

Epilleptic behaviour has been shown to have roots in excessive synchronization of the brain's neuronal activity. In order to develop effective treatment for this condition, along with a general understanding of neurophysiological processes, there is need for research on the emergence of synchronization on neuronal network models. A promising approach is the study of networks of coupled Fitzhugh-Nagumo oscillators, which can show large scale synchronization events in complex networks. With this in mind, we hope to develop and study a simple one dimensional model of neuronal networks, based on the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model of an individual neuron's activity, which can qualitatively capture epilleptic-like synchronization events. We study the phase space dynamics of such a model using analytical and computational tools to characterize the synchronization events. This can then be used to study the effects of non-local connections and synchronization time delay in the emergence of macroscopic synchronization, and as a starting point to explore strategies for controlling these epilleptic events.

#### Notes:

To install the dependencies for Julia, run install_dependencies.jl. As for now, I haven't yet implemented the project framework (project.toml), but it will be done some day.
