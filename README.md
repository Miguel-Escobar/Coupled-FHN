# Coupled-FHN

 Introduction to Research II project at Universidad de Chile, under the guidance of Prof. Ignacio Bordeu and MSc. Javier Cubillos.

### Abstract:

Epilleptic behaviour has been shown to have roots in excessive synchronization of the brain's neuronal activity. In order to develop effective treatment for this condition, along with a general understanding of neurophysiological processes, there is need for research on the emergence of synchronization on neuronal network models. A promising approach is the study of networks of coupled Fitzhugh-Nagumo oscillators, which can show large scale synchronization events in complex networks. With this in mind, we hope to develop and study a simple one dimensional model of neuronal networks, based on the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model of an individual neuron's activity, which can qualitatively capture epilleptic-like synchronization events. We study the phase space dynamics of such a model using analytical and computational tools to characterize the synchronization events. This can then be used to study the effects of non-local connections and synchronization time delay in the emergence of macroscopic synchronization, and as a starting point to explore strategies for controlling these epilleptic events.

#### Notes:

As I read more about the subject, I found incredibly useful works by E. Schöll, a professor at TU Berlin university. This is providing me with a general framework to follow. For now, this also means that the approach will not be too novel, and very much based on the techniques presented in the works by Schöll and their collaborators.
